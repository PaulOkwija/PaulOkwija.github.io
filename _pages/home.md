Hello, Welcome to my corner! I am Paul, a self-taught programmer passionate about harnessing the power of machine learning to drive social change. With a focus on healthcare, I aim to leverage the power of AI, especially in computer vision and natural language processing, to create solutions that make healthcare more accessible for everyone.

I envision becoming a professional who creates consumer-ready machine learning applications. I am actively learning and expanding my expertise and improving my skills through coding challenges like CloudFlight Coding Contest and Zindi.

When I'm not coding or exploring the latest advancements in AI, I'm immersed in Games, Music, and Japanese Anime. Music keeps me grounded and in tune with the world.
